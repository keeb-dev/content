# Getting started
* Angry IP scanner to find managed switch IP (10.0.0.53.) Make this static so you don't have to find it again.
* Raspberry PI - static IP 10.0.0.162 from dhcp server
* Enable SSH - make ssh start on startup
* ssh-keygen on rpi
* ssh-keygen on windows box
* copy id file over to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (not known_hosts, dumbass)
* Setup ~/.ssh/config
* Setup rsub for sublimetext remote editing without silly samba or sshfs (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37458814/how-to-open-remote-files-in-sublime-text-3)
* Create github repo
* add rpi public key

Decide on hosting..

github pages
cloudflare workers
netlify


Decide on platform

I should warn that bike shedding about this distinction is absolutely not worth your time if you’re reading this and have less than like 100 blog posts written or are running a business on these sites (in which case I think you should pick Netlify). Go write something.
